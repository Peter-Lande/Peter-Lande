### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter Lande. I develop software for embedded devices, mostly specializing in logger software. I like to write in Rust and Python. I unfortunately also write in C++. 

I like to cook and climb! I don't do a lot of personal projects since I got a job, I might do something sometime in the near future.

I like to make small games in Rust. I also like to make tooling.
